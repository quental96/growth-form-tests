class Form:
    """
    Represents a geometric form as a triangulated manifold composed of interconnected cells.

    The Form class manages the creation, adjacency, and region relationships of cells,
    as well as geometric and topological operations on the structure. It supports
    spring-based relaxation for cell positions, region-based distance queries, and
    all-pairs shortest path calculations for topological analysis.

    Attributes:
        cell (list[Cell]): List of all cells in the form.
        region_r (int): Maximum number of hops for a cell's region neighborhood.
        bud_types (list): List of bud types present in the form.
        genus (int): Number of holes in the form (topological genus).

    Methods:
        __init__(verts, adjs, region_r): Initialize the form from vertex coordinates and
        adjacency lists.
        count_hops(): Compute all-pairs shortest hop distances between cells.
        dist(v1, v2): Return the hop distance between two cells as measured by the region map.
        solve3(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I): Solve a symmetric 3x3 system of equations 
        and return an XYZ.
        spring_xyz(v): Use a spring model to nudge the xyz location of a given cell.
